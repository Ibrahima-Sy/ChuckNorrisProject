Hello,

This project aims to deliver an app able to print out Jokes on ChuckNorris using Android Studio and Kotlin language.

Through these different steps I managed to implement a working app that prints out Jokes from the https://api.chucknorris.io/#! website
by taking a json format joke and serializing it using kotlinw--serialization to use it in our app.

There I've learned:

- How to organise a simple display and to customize it using recyclerview, a layout Inflater and ways to customize the outplay with the xml files ressource parameters and constraints
- How to refrain data to get deleted when the process starts over while turning device on Landscape ode for example
- How to create an object (here Joke) and manipulate it with different tools
- How to add and use plugins from other sources to get to a solution

Thank you for reading me,
I am available for any further informations,
